# Contributing to Riley EduTrust Protocol

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Riley Edu Trust! It is people like you who will help bridge the trust gap in the global education industry.

As a protocol initiated by a builder with deep roots in sales in this filed, we value practical solutions that solve real-world transaction flaws. Whether you are a Rust developer, a UI designer, or a study-abroad consultant, your input is welcome.

## 🟢 How Can You Help?

### 1. Technical Development
- **Smart Contracts**: We are building on the Casper Network using the Odra framework. Help us optimize the escrow and auto-refund logic.
- **Frontend**: Improve the React dashboard to make it more intuitive for non-crypto native parents and students.
- **Integrations**: Assist in connecting more wallet providers or building a notification system for milestone updates.

### 2. Market Research & Logic
- **Industry Insights**: If you have experienced "refund traps" in agency contracts, share your story or help us refine the legal-to-code logic.
- **Localization**: Help us adapt the protocol for different regions (e.g., SE Asia, MENA, or Europe) where study-abroad demand is high.

### 3. Testing
- Bug reports and UX feedback are extremely valuable. Please open an "Issue" if you find something broken.

## 🛠️ Development Process

1. **Fork the Repo**: Create your own copy of the project.
