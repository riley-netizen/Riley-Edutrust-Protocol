The "Trust Deficit" in the Education Consulting Industry in China

## 1. Segmentation of Services: General vs. Projects-based
In the industry, products generally fall into two categories:
* **Standardized Applications (General)**: Fees vary by country and university rankings. These are high-volume, process-driven services.
* **Project-Based Applications**: The transaction value is very high, the service requires long-term tracking and servicing.

Regardless of the category, the pricing remains opaque, and the risk remains entirely on the student's side.

## 2. The Core Problem: The "Information Gap" & Incentive Decay
The primary "product" these agencies sell is **Information Asymmetry**. Before the contract is signed, the agency acts as a gateway to "exclusive insights." However, a significant systemic flaw exists in the Web2 business model:

* **Pre-Payment vs. Post-Payment Service**: Agencies are highly motivated during the sales phase. However, once 100% of the fee is collected upfront into a private corporate bank account, the incentive to provide high-quality service drops dramatically. 
* **The "Vanishing" Service**: Since the student has no financial leverage after payment, they often experience "service delay"—slower response and generic, low-quality application essays (the "template" problem).

## 3. The Refund Paradox: "No Offer, No Fee" is a Myth
Most agencies market themselves with a "No Offer, No Fee" guarantee. But in reality, this is nearly impossible for a student to enforce:
* **The 100% Risk**: The agency holds 100% of the funds from Day 1.
* **Hidden Costs**: If an application fails, agencies often deduct "administrative fees," "translation fees," or "consultation hours," meaning the student never gets a full refund.
* **The Burden of Proof**: In Web2, the student must prove the agency failed. In our Protocol, the **Agency must prove they succeeded** to get the money.

## 4. Why Blockchain?
Traditional banking and legal systems are too slow and expensive to resolve the dispute and it protect clients from losing all money once the agencies failed and choose to vanish.

By using **Riley-Edutrust-protocol**, we flip the script:
1.  **Funds as Code**: The money is held by a Smart Contract, not the agency.
2.  **Milestone Enforcement**: The "General Application" teacher only gets paid when the student confirms the service quality at each stage.
3.  **Guaranteed Liquidity**: If no offer letter is uploaded to the chain by the deadline, the refund is not a "request" to the agency—it is an automated execution of the protocol.

## 5. High-Stakes "Special Programs": Beyond Just an Offer
There is a "deeper" segment in the industry: **Project-Based / Executive Degree Programs**. These target working professionals (Master/PhD) who need degrees for:
* **Talent Immigration & Residency (Hukou)**
* **Government Housing Subsidies**
* **Career Promotion & Salary Increments**

### The "Deep Water" Risk:
1.  **The Certification Gap**: For these students, the goal isn't just the "Offer," but the final **Degree Authentication (CSCSE/Equivalency Certification)**. If the degree cannot be authenticated after 1-3 years of study, the student hasn't just lost money—they’ve lost years of their career and life.
2.  **The Time Lag & Information Asymmetry**: Agencies often realize a program is failing months before the student does. They use this "Time Lag" to hide the truth while funneling remaining assets out of the company.
3.  **Exit Scams (Rug Pulls)**: By the time the student realizes the degree is invalid or the offer isn't coming, the agency has often "vanished" (Absconded with funds).

### Our Protocol's Critical Defense:
In these high-stakes cases, **Riley Edu Trust** acts as a "Dead Man's Switch":
- **Multi-Year Escrow**: Funds are not released just for an Offer, but for some projects it can be held in a long-term vault tied to graduation and successful authentication.
- **Proof of Progress**: Agencies must provide verifiable proof of the university's accreditation status at each milestone. 
- **Anti-Absconding Mechanism**: Since the capital stays on the Casper Blockchain, the agency cannot "Rug Pull." Even if the agency closes its physical office, the student's funds remain safe in the smart contract, waiting to be reclaimed if the protocol's conditions are not met.
