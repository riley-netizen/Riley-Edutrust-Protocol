# Riley-Edutrust-Protocol
it is a decentralized portocol, specifically designed to solve the blind trust and refund crisis in the 300 - 500 billion CNY valued international education industry. As a salesperson &amp; content creator in this area, I have identified a significant "trust issue" where client lose all leverage after payment and there is always a possibility that agencies might abscond with the money if clients did not receive offer at the end.

### *Securing the Future of International Education with Blockchain Trust*

## 🌟 Vision
**CasperEdu Trust** is a decentralized escrow and payment protocol built on the Casper Network. Having spent years selling products in internal education industry in China, I have witnessed the systemic flaws in traditional "pay-first, service-later" models. 

This project aims to bridge the trust gap in the **$500B global education market** by moving high-stakes agency contracts from opaque Web2 systems to transparent, self-executing Web3 smart contracts.

## 🔴 The "Real-World" Problem
In the industry, students face a massive **"Refund Black Hole"**:
- **Information Asymmetry**: Agencies demand 100% upfront payment but offer little transparency.
- **Refund Traps**: Despite "No Offer, No Fee" promises, recovering funds after a rejection is legally complex and often impossible for students.
- **Service Inefficiency**: Agencies lose incentive once the full payment is secured in their private bank accounts.
- **Contract Loophole**：Agencies deliberately included contract loophole in the contract that were biased in their favor.

## ✅ The  Solution
I replace "Blind Trust" in agencies with "Programmable Trust" on the Blockchain:
- **Smart Escrow**: Funds are locked in a secure contract, not the agency's pocket.
- **Milestone-Based Release**: Payments are released only when specific goals are met (e.g., Application Submission, Offer Receipt).
- **Automated Refund Logic**: If the agency fails to deliver an offer by the deadline, the contract automatically triggers a refund to the student's wallet.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Escrow-as-a-Service**: A specialized gateway for education-related high-value transactions.
- **Milestone Tracking**: Visual progress of the application status synced with on-chain fund release.
- **Immutable Reputation**: Agencies build a public "Proof of Success" record based on successfully completed contracts.
- **Low-Barrier UX**: Designed for students and parents who are not crypto-natives.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Smart Contract Framework**: Odra 
- **Frontend**: React.js & Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration**: Casper Wallet

## 📈 Market Potential
- **TAM**: $500 Billion Global International Education Market.
- **Target**: $7 Billion consulting market (China) where refund disputes are the #1 consumer complaint.
